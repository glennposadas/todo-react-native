# todo-react-native
This is my very first react native app. I'm following a tutorial on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCA4qpQDZD8&amp;ab_channel=DevEd to see what I've been doing wrong in running the react-native android project that I'm assigned to. The current problem is that react says android sdk is found but no support versions found.
